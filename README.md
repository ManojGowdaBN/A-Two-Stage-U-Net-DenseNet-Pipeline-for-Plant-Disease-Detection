# A-Two-Stage-U-Net-DenseNet-Pipeline-for-Plant-Disease-Detection
Designed and implemented a deep learning pipeline using U-Net for leaf segmentation and DenseNet121 with transfer learning for plant disease classification, improving precision by focusing on diseaserelevant regions. Enhanced overall model robustness by effectively handling complex backgrounds and variability in leaf appearance.
